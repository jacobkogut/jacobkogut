# Hey, I'm Jacob ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineering student at McGill University (Minor in Aerospace Engineering) passionate about **low-latency systems**, **embedded development**, and **aerospace software**.

Iâ€™ve built everything from **latency-sensitive trading infrastructure** to **mission control systems for rockets**, and I love tackling performance-critical problems â€” whether thatâ€™s squeezing microseconds out of a C++ hot path or pushing telemetry sampling rates to the limit.

ðŸ’» **Current interests:**  
- Modern C++ & systems programming  
- Embedded microcontrollers (FreeRTOS, ARMv7)  
- Aerospace & robotics software  
- Performance profiling and optimization  

ðŸš€ **Notable projects & work:**  
- Market data tooling for an algorithmic trading firm  
- Avionics software for the McGill Rocket Team  
- Wireless IoT sound sensor with BLE & FreeRTOS
